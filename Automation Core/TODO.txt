HIGH PRIORITY:
add arduino ethernet support as a node
add arduino code

LOW PRIORITY:
ADD the ability for multiple MPD nodes rather then just one - mpd should act as a node, not something specialy coded - DONE, but MPDControl need to be a non static class and should be stored in the node array

add support for creating mpd playlists based on subfolders
Add support for rooms/locations, lots of config, every detail
add more detail to all devices, more location information, both physical and virtual, for relays, physical location of the relay and of what it controls
